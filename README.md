## General Information
- Project background - The Consumer finance company  specialises in lending various types of loans to urban customers. When the company receives a loan application, the company has to make a decision for loan approval based on the applicant’s profile. The dataset provided contains the information about past loan applicants and whether they ‘defaulted’ or not. The aim is to identify patterns which indicate if a person is likely to default, which may be used for taking actions such as denying the loan, reducing the amount of loan, lending (to risky applicants) at a higher interest rate, etc

- Business probem the project is trying to solve - The Lending company wants to identify that to whom they can extend the loan and to whom they should avoid by analyzing the risks associated. Business needs to understand the various factors which may lead to Loan Default

- Dataset being used - Lending Club dataset containing the information about past loan applicants and whether they ‘defaulted’ or not.



## High level conclusions of the Lending Club Case Study
- Grading is an important variable on which Lending Club can detect the defaulters as low-grade loans have more chances to default.

- Loans having higher interest rate have more defaulters. Lending club should reduce the high interest loans and should verify the
background of applicant thoroughly.

- In case of debt consolidation also the default tendency is pretty high. As such, Lending club should have a check on that as well.

- Region wise as well club should have a control as states like CA and FL, as tendency to default is high.

- For detailed summary and insights, kindly refer the presenatation and jupyter runbook.
